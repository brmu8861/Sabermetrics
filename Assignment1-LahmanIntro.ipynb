    "The Mendoza Line is a baseball expression named after shortstop Mario Mendoza, whose batting average through most of his career has been adopted to define the threshold needed for a player to remain in Major League Baseball. When a position player's batting average falls below .200, the player is said to be 'below the Mendoza Line'. This is often thought of as the offensive threshold below which a player's presence in Major League Baseball cannot be justified, regardless of his defensive abilities. The term has been adopted in other contexts as well when one is so incompetent in one key skill that other skills cannot compensate for that deficiency, e.g. Professor X's FCQ scores are below the Mendoza Line. \n",

    "5. (20 pts) Create a dataframe of all position players - not pitchers - with a batting average (BA) below the Mendoza Line since 2010. Your dataframe needs to include the player's playerID, first name, last name, team name, position, BA, and AB. If a player had multiple teams in 2010, you can include both teams as a separate line in the dataframe."

Could different criteria produce a different answer? \n",

You need to use more than one metric for evaluating pitchers. Your answer also needs to include the data, and the code you write to generate that data, to support your explanation."
